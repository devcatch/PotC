"Hello. What brings you here to our humble little jail?",
"Curiosity and nothing more. Just taking a look around.",
"Hello. What brings you here to our humble little jail?",
"I was told that my gunner Edgar Attwod is kept here.",
"Ah yes, I know of this prisoner. He was arrested for fighting with a royal guard just yesterday. As you can imagine, this is quite a serious charge. I'm afraid your friend will pay dearly for this.",
"Ah. Poor Edgar. At least in jail he'll be kept away from ale.",
"Trouble does seem to find him where ever he sets foot in a tavern. If I promise to keep after him, can I arrange his release?",
"Well...I was thinking. Since he didn't hurt the soldier too badly, and he has behaved himself thus far in his cell, we could arrange his release, for a modest sum.",
"You know, I'd be very grateful if you'd do that. What sum might be appropriate?",
"I think that 5000 gold will do fine.",
"I wouldn't pay that sum for five thousand Edgars, let alone one. I appreciate the offer, but I have to refuse.",
"Well, sounds reasonable. Here is the money.",
