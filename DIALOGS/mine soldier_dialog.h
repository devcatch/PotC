"I'm sorry, is there a dog in here? I'm sure you couldn't have been addressing a captain that way.",
"You? A captain? You've never seen a ship in your life. Now, work, I say!",

"The governor? All right, all right. Maybe you're telling the truth. But get to work, while I tell my superiors your story.",

"We'll see!",
