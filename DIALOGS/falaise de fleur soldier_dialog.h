"Can't you see that I'm on duty! Don't bother me.",
"All right, all right.",
"Don't you want to inform me about some crime?",
"No, of course. After all I'm a captain. I see you are not listening.",
"Remember - we don't allow fighting in the streets! You can fight only if somebody attacks you.",
"Right, I'll consider that information.",
"Such weather, and I've got to stay here. Believe it or not, the only entertainment that I have is to fight with flies that are trying to land on my face.",
"A shame, but I can't help you. It's your job.",
"If you want to chat find somebody else, I've got to focus on my job and can't talk to you.",
"I was just wondering whether you are alive or not. You are standing here like a statue.",

"Tell me some other time, I've got to go.",
"Go your way, don't bother me.",
"As you say, soldier.",

"And you call it to serve? look, don't miss some dangerous criminal such as me. ha-ha!",
"You look very healthy! Don't you want to join our army? We've got a lot of room in our barracks, good food, rum for free.",
"Sounds good, but I must refuse. I couldn't deal with the army's discipline.",
"This heat ... I'd give all that I have to return to my lovely France with it's flourishing flowers and smell of grass.",
"Yes, it looks like this weather doesn't suit you.",
"What do you want?",
"You...hic...you scurvy cur! You hurt my...hic...my friend!",
"What friend? You're alone here, ",
".",
"What? He was...here a minute ago. I'll go find him. You...hic...you'll wait here if you want your beating!",
"How dare you contradict me! I'm gonna strangle you!",
