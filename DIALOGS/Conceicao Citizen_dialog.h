"No one. Never mind.",
"Senor governor is a perfect gentleman. While he is here, we haven't had any serious problems. The only thing I can say about him is ... hmm ... he's a bit too... thrifty. But maybe that's for the better.",
"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you. Goodbye.",
"I wouldn't let this man deal with your money. They say he is somehow connected with smugglers and pirates.",
"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you. Goodbye.",
"He makes good ships... I don't really know him. He lives a quite humble life. I think he's not a bad person, ",
"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you. Goodbye.",

"I see. Thanks and goodbye.",
"And where is the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell the goods I've brought with me?",
"You can find the shipyard office on the central square. It is located just in front of governor's residence. There hangs a sign 'Estaleiro Naval' - that's 'shipyard' in Portugese.",
"How can I get to the tavern?",
"Where can I sell the goods I've brought with me?",

"To the right from the port's gates, just in front of the tavern, you'll find what you seek.",

"What do you want to talk about?",
"Please.",
"What do you know about the colony's history...",
"Is there any interesting besides the town on this island?",
"Do you know anything about the fort that protects the city?",
"Let's change the subject.",
"Are you really interested? Excellent! Our colony was established only 40 years ago,\nbut because of its good location, the founders opened trade routes and quickly built up the city.\nNow it’s one of the fastest-growing colonies in our archipelago.",
"Continue...",
"So it's the usual story. Let’s forget about history for now.",
"They had to build a powerful fort to protect the colony. Sometimes, though, it seems useless to me, as no one has ever tried attack our colony anyway.",
"I see. Let’s take another tack, shall we?",
"I'm not familiar with the landscape much. There's nothing here but deserted beaches, mountains, and jungle, which starts just outside the city. They say there are a couple of convenient little bays out there, where you can land safely and no one will notice you from the sea... Hmm, I guess that's about all we got here.",
"Boring. Tell me something else.",
"Only a part of the island has been explored so far. But who needs it anyway? Enjoy the untouched nature. They say that smugglers have built themselves a nice little hideout somewhere out there.",
"I see. Continue...",
"There is a smuggler settlement in the jungle. I've heard that they've carved out a nice path to one of the islands' secluded bays from it.",
"I see. Let's hear more...",
"I see. Let me ask you something else.",
"I am hardly interested in that, captain.",
"Too bad. What else can you tell me?",
"The local aristocracy paid very generously for the fort's construction, so it's in a pretty good shape. The riches of our city are well known,\nso the number of soldiers garrisoned here has increased. There are already a thousand.",
"I see. Continue...",
"I'm not sure I should be jabbering on about it. I don't know you that well. I am sure you understand.",
"Don't worry about it. It's not important.",
"I see. Let me ask you something else, if I may.",
