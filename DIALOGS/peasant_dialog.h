"Yeah - I guess I don't really have a choice.",
"You're alive? You should count yourself blessed to survive such a tempest. I haven't seen a storm like that in all my years!",
"So, where am I?",
"Douwesen. It would appear the sea brought you here.",
"Any sign of my ship and crew! Where are they?",
"No. You should thank your stars I was here to take you out of the water. If I were you, I'd head to the city. Your crew may already be there looking for you.",
"That's a good idea. Thanks.",
