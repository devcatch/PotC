"Thank you, sir. Nigel Blythe has always been quick with punishment. If you hadn't stepped in when you did, I'd surely be dead now.",
"Yeah, I've noticed you had some difficulties with him.",
"Yeah, I've noticed you had some difficulties with him.",
"It's true. I was a navigator on Nigel's ship. He wasn't much of a seaman himself, to be frank. \nNot long ago, we took on a huge load of cargo, destined for an island none of us had seen before. The ship ended up beached by a storm. \nWe escaped, but the vessel and cargo were destroyed. Nigel blamed me for everything.",
"And now you have no captain.",
"We haven't yet been introduced. I'm ",

"My name is Artois Voisey, and I do indeed find myself grounded. I'd be glad to serve with you, if you deem me worthy.",
"Thanks, but I've already got a navigator.",
"It's a deal. But please, try not to sink my ship.",
"What can I do for you, captain?",
"What?",
"Just passing by.",
"At ease.",
"Captain, these men have killed my friend... an old friend, and they wanted to kill me, too...",
"Yeah, right. Now tell me - why did they attack you in the first place?",
"I'm afraid that's a secret, sir, and not mine to tell. I'm bound by the code of Morgan and Bartholemew.",
"That may be, but you're not exactly a pirate, and I'm your captain. And if you don't want your life to end all too soon, you'll tell me everything right now!",
"You're a man of honor, Artois. I respect that. Keep your secret.",
"You make a good point, sir. I'll tell you all I can. \nSomehow, Nigel Blythe learned of a ship that ran aground near Conceicao, carrying treasure in its hold. We were headed there when we were shipwrecked ourselves. \nWhen you killed Nigel, I became the only man alive who knows the way to this treasure. That's why Blythe's former crew is after me. \nI'd never tell them what I know - but I'll tell you, because I believe you're an honest man. More or less. The treasure is located on Douwesen. You can find the path to the wrecked ship under the waterfall.",
"Now we're talking!",
"Thanks, Captain. I knew I could count on you.",
"You're welcome. Glad to see you alive and well.",
"Is something else troubling you?",
"Yes, I've fallen into disgrace with local authorities because of this commotion...",
"Oh, don't worry, I think I can solve this problem.",
"Yes, maybe you can, you've... heh-heh... witnessed all this yourself.",
"Thanks you, captain! You've saved my life yet again. Now I think I can tell you my secret. \nSomehow, Nigel Blythe learned of a ship that ran aground near Conceicao, carrying treasure in its hold. We were headed there when we were shipwrecked ourselves. \nWhen you killed Nigel, I became the only man alive who knows the way to this treasure.

"Thank you, Artois, I won't forget your help.",
"Just one request, captain. I've sworn that if I make it out of this adventure alive, I would donate 4000 gold to the church in Redmond.",
"Of course, we'll do it! Now let's be on our way.",
