"Cash and carry - that's the way we do business here!",
"Here's your gold, funny man.",

"Awfully nice to deal with you.",
"I'd be awfully glad if you'd leave.",
"What?! You don't have enough money! Trying to cheat us, eh?! Die!",
"Damn!",
"See, that's not so funny. I'd kill our guest before your sword cleared its scabbard. Then no one would be laughing.",
"All right, all right. Some people have no sense of humor. Here's your money.",
