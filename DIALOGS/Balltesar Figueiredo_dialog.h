"You! Get out!",

"Well, look who it is! Maybe you'll buy a drink for the best navigator in this foul archipelago? Or, at least, not the worst!",
"I'm sorry. I don't believe we've ever met.",
"Even better! We will celebrate our new friendship!",
"I'm more interested in information at the moment. I wonder if your ship has ever run across a black frigate.",
"I'm happy to answer questions until the seasons change - as long as I've got a mug of rum before me.",
"Here's your rum. Let's see if it loosens your tongue.",
"How about if I slap you silly instead? How would that be?",
"Ahhh. Good rum!",
"You haven't answered my question.",
"Question? Ah, the black frigate! Yes. I saw it as clearly as I see you now. If our holds hadn't been empty, I doubt I would be here to speak with you. Fortunately for my comrades and I, the frigate's holds must have been full, and we were able to slip away. \nStrange name, as I recall. Not one I'd heard before. 'Mefisto.'",
"So, did the black frigate give chase? And where did it go when it became clear it couldn't run your vessel down?",
"Who knows? Somewhere to the south, it seemed. But only Quebradas Costillas lies in that direction.",
"Thanks. Enjoy your rum.",
"Yes. That might work, too. Perhaps we'll just forget about the rum.",
"You didn't answer my question.",
