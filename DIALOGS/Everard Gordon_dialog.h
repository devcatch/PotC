"Welcome, welcome, ",
". You'll find everything your heart desires at Everard Gordon's tavern. If I don't have it, I know where to get it!",
"Thanks for the warm welcome. I'm ",
".",
"Welcome, my dear ",
". I'm so glad to see you again in my tavern.",
"! What can I get you?",
"Why, hello, ",
".",
"I'm looking to beef up my crew.",
"I'd like to talk to you, if you have a moment.",
"I'd stay here for a short while.",
"Is there is a spare cot in this shack?",
"I'll be on my way now, ",
". Farewell.",
"What can I do for my friend ",
"?",
"I need to hire some sea dogs for my crew - preferably smarter than actual dogs.",
", let's talk.",
"I'm stuck here for a bit.",
"Is there is a free bed in this dump?",
"I'll be seeing you, ",
". Farewell.",
"As it happens, I do have some rooms. How long did you plan to stay?",
"Until morning. I could use the rest.",
"Just until tonight.",
"It will cost you 5 gold pieces.",
"I guess you can get away with that when you're the only game in town. Here's your gold.",
"That's a pity. My aching back wants a clean bed, but my purse says I'm sleeping in the tavern hall.",
"Five?! What, would you put the governor himself out of his bed for me? Forget it. I'll save my money and sleep in the common room.",
"All right, I'll have to think about it.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold pieces.",
"Fine. Here's your money.",
"That's more than I can spend at the moment. I suppose I'll have to pass the night in the common room - with rest of the commoners.",
"For that kind of money, I'd expect a bed, a bath, and a seven-course meal! Forget it. Suddenly the common room looks much better to me.",
"I'll have to think about it. In the mean time, answer another question for me.",
"Certainly. What do you want to know, Captain ",
"?",
"I'd like to know how the local citizens feel about the French soldiers garrisoned here.",
"Any gossip worth repeating.",
"There's some business I'd like to discuss with you...",
"Business? Now we're talking!",
"You know, now that I think of it, we don't have anything to talk about.",
"Have you seen a man around here by the name of ",
"Counterspy",
"?",
"Do you recall the French officer I spoke to last time I was here?",
"Looks like the French fleet got a new addition recently.",
"Is your boat ready, ",
"?",
"I need any information you can give me about a gentleman you must have seen around here. You could hardly miss him - he always wears a red robe, and he goes only by the name of 'Teacher'.",
"I need a job. Don't you know any rich boys on this island who are afraid to travel alone?","If there is such a person, he might prefer to avoid attracting attention with so many consorts - as I'd expect you to know.", 
"Yes, I forgot. All right, I'll come back later, when I have fewer ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you. You've caused too much trouble for my country.",
"Quite the patriot, aren't you? Well, goodbye then.", 
"Your hands are covered in blood. You don't seriously think that anyone would travel with you, do you?",
"You are right, everyone's afraid of me! Ha-ha!",
"You came just in time. A merchant here was searching for the right company to travel with. You'd better talk to him - here he is now, coming in to the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is no one like that at the moment, Maybe next time.",
"Hmm, then I will wait.",
"Yes, I do remember him. Fool got himself arrested in Greenford. They say he tried to start an uprising. If you must speak to him, I'm sure you'll find him in Greenford's jail.",
"Thanks. I appreciate your help.",
"Interesting. By the way, I'm looking to add to my crew.",
"I'd like to talk to you.",
"I'll take my leave off you now, ",
". Farewell.",
"As you wish, captain. As you wish.",
"Thanks. That might come in handy down the road. Meanwhile, I need a crew.",
"I'd like to talk to you.",
"I'll see you next time, ",
". Farewell.",
"Look around you, captain! Who would you hire? Every able-bodied man has been taken by the French to work on their ships.",
"I see. A pity. Perhaps you can help me with something else, then.",
"If you'll pardon me, I'll be going now, ",
". Good luck to you.",
"The French? How do you think we feel about them? \nThey promised they would harm no one, and then they sacked half the city! \nPoor ",
"Mildred Backer",
" had to flee for her life. \nAnd her father was cut down like an animal when he resisted!",
"It's worse than I thought. Tell me, ",
", would you like to see the English flag raised over Oxbay again?",
"It's terrible, captain! The French took our fort by surprise and captured it with almost no losses to their side. Afterwards, they declared that \nwe were under the protection of the French Crown. Protection, they said! And soon after that, they started plundering! Filling their holds with supplies at our expense.",
"It's fair, then, to say that you are not happy with the way the French 'protect' you?",
"Captain, I pray for the day when these invaders are finally tossed from here and into the sea. They drink gallons of my best rum and ale, and I'm afraid to even ask them about payment!",
"Then you may be pleased to know that I come to you by order of Sir Robert Christopher Silehard.",
"The governor of Redmond? His Serene Highness knows about the attack, then? Why doesn't he get off his well-padded...throne...and recapture the colony?!",
"All in good time. For now, I'm collecting information on France's plans.",
"I see, yes. If there's anything I can do to aid your mission, just let me know.",
"What going on now in the city?",
"Virtually nothing. Most of the population is hiding, either in their houses or out in the jungle. The French have posted guards at the city gate, but every day several citizens manage to slip past them and out of town. \nAs to the French soldiers, they seem to see this occupation as their own mad party. Most of them are drunk at all hours. \nFurthermore, they're short-handed. Commanders of the fleet are hiring more and more sailors. They pay is quite good, I'm told\nBut to the point, sir ",
", this may well be a good time to send an emissary to the French.",
"A good bartender overhears a lot. Maybe you've managed to pick up some information about the French and their plans?",
"Well, now...this may amount to nothing, but...the other night, two drunken French officers were talking about a ship they were waiting for, heavily loaded with ammunition. \nThey seemed to hope it would take its time coming here, so they could continue to enjoy this party they're having at our town's expense! \nIt seems likely to me that, as soon as this shipment of ammunition arrives, the fleet will weigh anchor and move on to the next step of their battle plan, whatever that may be.",
"Thanks. That's exactly the sort of information I need.",
"I'm pleased to hear it. If I 'overhear' anything else of use, I'll let you know right away! \nWhen these pigs get drunk, they run their mouths like a sewing circle. If they won't pay for my ale with gold, they'll pay for it with information, whether they know it or not!",
"So a drunken French soldier is as good as a spy, eh?",
"That's a very good way of putting it, sir ",
"! If you could only hear what goes on here at night!",
"Maybe I can hear some of it, with your help.",
"You have an idea? I'm at your service!",
"My plan is pretty simple: You see that Frenchman there? Do you know him?",
"Certainly. He's an officer from the French frigate. Not much of an officer, though - he spends most of his time in here.",
"Perfect. And are you ready to spend some gold for the liberation of Oxbay?",
"Gold? Sir ",
", I'm afraid you've lost me.",
"It's very simple. I'm going to sit down with this man, and you're going to give him whatever he wants. Wine, ale, rum... we'll get him drunk, and I'll fish out any useful bits of information he might have swimming in his head.",
"But, sir ",
", I'm already going broke! Who will pay for all these drinks? I'm ready and willing to contribute to the liberation of Oxbay, but name a price I can afford!",
"Listen, Governor Silehard will gladly repay you for your expenses - and he'll throw in something extra for your trouble!",
"What price would you put on your own freedom?",
"Do you really think he will reward me, sir? Fine, then. Let's get down to business!",
"I knew you'd see it my way. Just hurry and bring on the drinks!",
"I'm sorry, but I can't live on a promise from the governor's man, can I? No, that Frenchman drinks like a fish. A whale! I can't give him all of his drinks for free.",
"You must be joking. You said yourself he's already not paying for what he drinks. What kind of a patriot are you?",
"Fine! If money is so important to you, just tell me how much you want.",
"Just a moment...let me think... ",
" gold pieces. And not one less! Look, I know that's a lot of gold, but it's war-time, isn't it?",
"Where I come from, we call that profiteering! Here's your gold. And bring me whatever the Frenchman is having, but be sure to water mine down. I'll want a clear head for this!",
"Everard, look - I don't have any money.",
"I'd settle down if I were you. There are French eyes and ears everywhere. Threaten me, and I'll turn you in!",
"Thief! How much do you want?",
"Don't worry, sir ",
", everything will go as you have planned!",
"Well.",
"No money at all? Well, I suppose I have no choice, then, but to rely on the governor's good graces. I'll remember what you promised.",
"Thank you, Everard!",
"It's not to their taste?! They come to my tavern every day and drink gallons of ale and rum, and I'm afraid even to mention payment to them when they stagger out in the morning!",
"And if I say...",
"No problem. You can get a room for just 10 gold pieces.",
"That's far too much!",
"Fine. Here's your money.",
"Hardouin Beauvallet",
"Hardouin Beauvallet",
"? Of course, he is another regular of my tavern. He comes here every evening and drinks a pair of bottles of my best wine. For free, naturally!",
"I'll wait for him here, then.",
"As a matter of fact, a French battleship entered port a day or two ago. If it comes to a straight naval battle, she'll send many an Englishman to a drowning death.",
"Then we should destroy that ship before any battle starts, don't you think?",
"A fine idea. But I don't know how you'd manage it. You couldn't get to it from the sea - not with the port so heavily defended. And to approach it from land would be suicide. Unless... Yes! Most of the ship's crew is in town at the moment - they were given shore leave. Only a skeleton crew is aboard now",
"What are you getting at?",
"It's just barely possible that a single boat, coming from shore by night, could reach the ship. If some brave men decided to try it, I'm sure I could find the proper boat.",
"Find that boat, then, ",
"!",
"Bring that boat to the port, then. We'll be waiting there.",
"Good, good. Nightfall is still some hours away. You're welcome to rest in one of my rooms until then. On the house! Today, your money is no good here.",
"Yes, that's a fine idea. I appreciate your hospitality.",
"It's time, ",
"! The boat is ready. Have you found your volunteers?",
"Yes. Tonight, the boat must be near the pier.",
"I'll be there...",
"Let's wait for dark, then.",
"Please, take a room in my tavern. For free, this time.",
"Thank you, ",
".",
"Be quiet! He's on the second floor. He'll be dressed in a French uniform, but that's part of his plan.",
"Thank you.",
"You won't have much luck now. It's dark, and everyone will be at home. \nIf I were you, I'd wait until the morning. Maybe you'd like to rent a room?",
"Do you have a vacancy?",
"Not just yet. Let me have a moment more of your time.",
"Stop this! Stop this madness at once, or I shall be forced to call the guards!",
"Relax. I'm already gone.",
