"Captain! It's you! I can scarce believe my eyes!",
"Believe them, my friend!",
"I didn't think I'd ever see you alive again, ",
"! But look at you! You're not just alive, you look like you've spent a month in London!",
"Men...",
"...It's a plain miracle you survived! God is with you, captain, and no mistake!",
"Oh, I doubt that!",
"The sea devil, then! I've heard it said he favors bold sailors and keeps them from  disaster!",
"You'd trade one tall tale for another!",
"It's no tall tale, captain! Jovannie Speckled from the brig 'Ardent' said he saw the sea devil himself!",
"He saw the devil? After how many bottles of rum?",
"He swore he never touched a drop, captain...",
"Wait for me here, fellows!",
"We'll be here. If something happens - just rush back to us, and we'll cover your escape!",
"I trust you will. But don't show yourself too soon.",
"We'll take him to the ship, captain. I'm glad everything has ended so well.",
"Has it? Go. Go, my friend, and I'll follow you soon.",
