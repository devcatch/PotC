"By the way, there's something you should know. Your friend will be transferred soon. If you're interested, I can tell you where and when. It'll only cost you 500 gold.",
"That's quite an offer. I appreciate the information, but perhaps I'll talk to the prison commandant, instead.",
"Sure. Here's the money. Now tell me about Edgar.",
"Edgar is going to be transferred to the mines of Oxbay. Tomorrow at six he will be put in the hold of a prison ship and sent to work the mines. Cannoneers make good miners! Right, Jack?",
"...",
"You seem like a good man, captain, so I'll tell you this. If you're serious about setting him free, don't try to free him from the prison. With the garrison here, there are too many blades and guns to even think about a rescue. I'd reckon the best approach would be to attack the convoy in the port.\n You could try to board the prison ship, if you're that eager to rescue Edgar. It'll be lightly guarded, and they won't be expecting an attack.",
"Thanks, Martin. I think I'll retire for the day and sleep off this rum.",
