". Do you need the services of my shipyard, ",
"?",
"Yes, my vessel is in need of repair.",
"No, I just want to talk.",
"No, I'm just visiting.",
"Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. If you're a captain, my shipyard is at your service.",
"Great, ",
". Let's get started on that repair.",
"Thanks. But first, let's talk.",
"Next time, perhaps. I've got to be on my way.",
"What exactly are you interested in, ",
"?",
"Nothing for now.",
"About that chest you asked me to take to Redmond....",
"Can I help you with anything else, ",
"?",
"Yes, I'm in need of your shipyard's services.",
"Thank you. That's everything. Farewell!",
"What exactly do you need?",
"I need to repair my ship - although I might consider just scrapping it and buying a new one.",
"I need to install new guns on my ship.",
"Nothing, thanks.",
"What are you thinking, ",
"? Do you really think the French will let me repair your ship under their very noses? They've put guards by every slip in my shipyard!",
"That's a shame.",
"What's happened? Is something wrong?",
"We need to hide. French soldiers are after us!",
"Why?",
"I don't know. Look, we can discuss it later. The soldiers will be here any minute now!",
"All right, I'll hide you. And don't worry - I'll put them off your scent if they show up here.",
"Thank you.",
"I showed the soldiers the door. So, maybe now you can tell me what happened?",
"It looks like the French suspect ",
"Counterspy",
".",
"And they've decided to catch him first and ask questions later?",
"That seems to be the size of it, yes. Thanks for your help.",
"Don't mention it. Maybe you could do me a favor in return. I need to get something to Redmond, but I'll only arouse suspicion if I take it there myself.",
"And this is something you couldn't ship the usual way?",
"No. The contents of this chest are extremely important. I can't trust some stranger with it - but I trust you.",
"\nThat's why I ask you to deliver it to Redmond, if you're willing.",
"After what you've done for me, how can I refuse?",
"Thank you. Please get this chest to ",
"Charles Windem",
" ",
"Charles Windem",
". He's the owner of the Redmond tavern. Tell him it's from me, and he'll understand. Fair winds to you, ",
".",
"And to you. Farewell.",
"Yes? Have you delivered it?",
"I'm afraid not. Someone got in the way. Or some...thing.",
"Some thing?!",
"Two men that couldn't be killed with a blade.",
"Good Lord! Then it's true...",
"What's true? Is there something you'd like to tell me?",
"Oh, no...no, it's nothing. It's just a pity that you were attacked....",
"Spill it, or spill blood. Make your choice.",
"Wait! I'll tell you what I know. There's a story about a horrible pirate. He ransacked and sank ships, he knew no mercy.... And one day he did something so terrible that God abandoned him forever. \nThis pirate became something unspeakable...the walking dead! They say he and his crew still hunt and loot ships, but now no one can hope to resist them - because they can't be killed! It's said that he's searching for something...ancient coins or treasure lost here in the archipelago.",
"That's madness! A story to frighten children.",
"Is it? You saw those dark pirates with your own eyes! I sent that chest to my old foe, ",
"Charles Windem",
", in the belief that it contained the treasure they sought. I hoped they might find him and kill him eventually. You have to believe me - I never thought they'd catch up with you first!",
"Where did you get that chest?",
"A man sold it to me. He asked very little in return and promised I could rid myself of my old rival simply by sending it to him.",
"Where I can find this man?",
"He lives on Falaise de Fleur, near the port! He's the one you want to talk to - he knows much more about that chest than I do!",
"If I weren't a man of honor, I'd make you pay for putting me in such danger!",
