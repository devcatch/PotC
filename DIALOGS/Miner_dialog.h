"Less talk and more work, friend! The guards are watching us.",
"You're right. I should save my breath.",
"You're awake, are you? Well, get to work, then. These slave-drivers don't like to see anyone lying about.",
"How did I get here?",
"The slave-traders brought you here. They claim they knocked you on the head and captured you.",
"And my crew?",
"Don't know. You're the only new face around here.",
"Well. As long as they're free, there's hope. They'll get me out of here soon enough.",
"I wouldn't count on that.",
"I don't plan to. I'll be looking for a way to spring myself.",
"You don't know my crew. They'll come for me!",
"Whatever you say, mate. Now get to work. There's a guard coming this way!",
"So? What's your point?",
