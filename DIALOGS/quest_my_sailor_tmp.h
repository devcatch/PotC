"You should know, it's been a long time since I've done this sort of thing.",
"I hope that doesn't affect your ability to fight.",
"Quite the opposite, I'm looking forward to it.",
"Well, don't be too eager to draw steel, there's risk enough as it is.",
"It's too quiet here. This means trouble.",
"For the enemy, perhaps...for us, silence is our ally.",
"But what if we're captured, captain?",
"They'll hang us I guess. Or behead us. Or burn...",
"Spare me. Just what are we going to do, captain?",
"Did you see the French battleship anchored here?",
"Yes, I saw her. A fearsome ship indeed.",
"We're going to capture her.",
"You're joking, ",
"? And how do you propose we do that? We won't even be able to approach her - one salvo from those guns and we're done for.",
"Ah, but the ship's crew was given shore leave and is now ashore, enjoying food and drink. The only crew aboard is the watch.",
"I see! We can sneak aboard, take the ship and join the English squadron! Oh, there'll be treasure and honors for sure. You'll be a hero, young laddie.",
"Well, that's not exactly the plan. I doubt we could sail away on her. There're too few of us to crew a ship like that.",
"Then what are we going to do?",
"The ship's hold is loaded with gun-powder. We'll blow it to pieces!",
"Oh, my God! What if we're blow up with her? And even if we're not, a blast aboard that beast will wake everybody in town!",
"If you're afraid - you can stay here.",
"Oh no, I'm coming with you! Nobody calls me a coward!",
"Let's go, then.",
"At your disposal, captain.",
"So, you're ready to volunteer?",
"Yes, we'll accompany you.",
"All right then, let's go.",
