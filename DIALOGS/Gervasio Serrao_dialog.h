"Sorry! I said I'd take you out, and I'm going to keep that promise.",
"What do you want?",
"It's nice to see you again. Have you finally decided to hire me?",
"I have. How much are you asking for your services?",
"I'll see you next time.",
"I don't want to fight you. I've got more sense than to fight those who are stronger than myself.",
"You're turning coward? You're so used to amateurs, you don't want a real challenge?",
"That's sensible. So what do you want?",
"To serve you! No one has ever beaten me in a straight fight before. Only you.",

"I suppose 2000 gold pieces per month will be enough.",
"Here is your money.",
"The problem is, I'm short on cash now. My ship and crew disappeared into the storm. I can't pay you right now.",
"No, that's too much for me.",
"That's not a problem. I'll wait as long as I need to.",
"Well then, let's consider it a deal. ",
"That won't work, I'm afraid. But do come back when you have money.",
"All right.",
"That's too bad. Well, I'll be here if you change your mind.",
"See you around.",
"I don't think you'll have to wait. I'll just kill you!",
