"You've come all this way just to learn local history? Well, all right. The colony was founded 54 years ago.\nThey found rich mineral deposits on the island, and the town gradually grew. We're doing quite well these days.",
"Please, continue.",
"Indeed. Let me ask you something else.",
"It's never been exactly peaceful around here. This land remembers more than its share of battles.",
"I see. Can I ask you something else?",
"I've heard rumors that some nobleman bought a house in the jungle, and nobody's seen this house, nor seen this nobleman.",
"Tell me more.",
"The entire island is covered with thick jungle. The shores are rocky, and there are many reefs. Our port lies in just about the only decent bay on the island.",
"I see. Tell me more.",
"There's not much more to tell. Jungle and rocks - just like all the other islands. Everything worthwhile is inside the town walls.",

"I see. Let me ask you something else, if I may.",
"To be honest, captain, I don't know anything about the local fort.",
"Well, let me ask you another question, if you don't mind.",
"Our fort was built in more prosperous times, and they really did it right. Even now, it's a formidable structure, although it has been through a lot. The garrison is quite impressive, too - around 1500 men.",
"I see. Tell me more.",
"I'm not sure we should be talking about the fort. What if you're a pirate, planning to attack it?",
"All right. Let's talk about something else, then.",
"I see. Let's try another subject, then.",
