"Make way there, I'm in a hurry.",
"Wait! Are you Florens Clauss, the former boatswain of Nigel Blythe?",
"Yes, that's me. And why do you care?",
"I'm looking for that rascal Nigel, and you're my last hope to find him.",
"That's true. But I owe some gold to one old geezer here....",
"Forget about it. Here is your debt note. Now you're free of your debt.",
"Huh! You're quick one, mister. Maybe you'll find a place for me on your boat? I'm not the worst boatswain here. I've spent twenty years at sea.",
"Why not? But tell me first - where is Nigel?",
"Want to get your revenge? He told everyone here that he has stolen a ship from some wim...captain.",
"Curses! I'll skin him alive. I'll cut his heart off with a spoon",
"I'll gladly help you with that. Now listen: I think you've heard that Blythe's former ship struck a shoal?\nBut I'm sure you haven't heard that her hold is full of silver taken from a Spanish galleon. Nigel wants to get that treasure back.\nBut if we set sail immediately, we should be able to catch him. He was never much of a seaman.",
"Ah. Now I see a new side of this business. And where has he left? Where is his ship?",
"On Douwesen, cap. We can't reach it from the sea - too many shoals and reefs there. But there is a secret cavern right before the waterfall on the island that leads right to the wreck.",
"Great! Welcome aboard!",
"What?",
"Nothing.",
