"I'm wondering about the owner of the shipyard.",
"I am interested in the local merchant.",
"Let's get back to this later.",
"Our governor is relatively young. They say that he is not very capable, and is the son of Spanish count. He hasn't been here long, and hasn't really accomplished anything interesting",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thanks. So long.",
"What can I say. he is just a man. He owns a tavern, so he knows all that is going on this island.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thanks. So long.",
"He is not good, this old man. He always grumble when somebody wants to buy a new ship and just dreaming about past.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thanks. So long.",
"He's known for his honesty and for quality of his goods.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",

". Where exactly do you want to go?",
"Where's the tavern?",
"Where can I find the shipyard?",
"I need to find someone who'll give me a fair price for my goods.",
"Go straight from the sea gate through the bridge. You'll see a sign on the building directly in front of you - that's the tavern.",
"Got it. Thanks.",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell the fine goods I've brought with me?",
"The shipyard manager's office is to the left of the market square. Go straight through the bridge from the town sea gate and then turn to the left. Then walk some more, and just past a small ladder you'll see the shipyard sign.",
"I see. And how can I get to the tavern?",
"I need to find someone who'll give me a fair price for my goods.",
"Thanks for your help. That's all I need for now.",
"Going from the town sea gate, take the first street to the right. Walk down that street until it ends, then go downstairs. There you'll find the shop.",
"Where can I find the local shipyard?",
"How can I get to the tavern?",
"Thanks for your help. That's all I need for now.",
"Well, all right, ",
" - but I don't know what's so interesting here.",
"Sure, I'll tell you about it with pleasure, captain.",
"You're always welcome! I love to chat! So relax and listen,",
".",
"I'm interested in the history of this colony...",
"Is there anything besides the town on this island?",
"Let's change the subject.",
"The history of our island? Well, it was established not too long ago, \nbut since the island turned out to be very rich and fertile, it grew pretty quickly. \nNow it's the one of the finest colonies in our archipelago.",
"Go on.",
"Yeah, that's what they all say. Let me ask you about something else.",
"Naturally, they sent a governor from the mainland and built a powerful fort \nto protect the colony. I believe it's for the best, really. I like the peaceful life.",
"Got it. Let me ask you about something else.",
"No, there's nothing else on this little rock but deserted beaches, mountains, and \nwild jungle.... The jungle starts right outside of town, in fact. Several paths lead into it, but only a madman would venture in \nthere without good reason. Besides the predatory animals, there are also predatory men - outlaws who make their home there.",
"Sounds dangerous. What else can you tell me?",
"Well, generally speaking, the island is still wild and undeveloped. Clearing all the jungle that surrounds the town \nis a daunting proposition. But the earth is very fertile, and the few plantations built here yield \nrich crops. Little by little, the plantations will replace the jungle, and \nthe island will be covered with farms, fields, and roads. For now, there's just the one port town.",
"I see. Anything else?",
"Well, there is a marvelous mountain ridge...gorgeous wild jungle...miles of deserted beaches...and not much else. All of the real action is in town.",
"Go on.",
"I see. Let's tackle a new subject, shall we?",
