"Let's talk about something else.",
"Ah, you're interested in that, are you? There's a good man. People don't usually care about such things. Unfortunately, I'm not an expert on such things, but I'll tell you what I know. This colony was built about 40 years ago. The island is fairly small, but it has fertile soil, and there are a few convenient bays for shipping and fishing.\nSince new colonies have been springing up, the trade and our city have grown tremendously.",
"Continue...",
"Good. Now, let's talk about something else.",
"Ah yes. The fort. Well, not so long ago, buccaneers and pirates were a frequent problem, what with ransacking and pillaging the town. The fort was built to protect the city. Now things are much more secure.",
"I see. Now, if we may change the subject...",
"The island is fairly well-tamed, and there's plenty of goods, water and crops. Though further development has been difficult because of the thick jungle around the city. It's tough to clear land, and we don't have enough people to do that...",
"All right, tell me something else.",
"There's nothing special about the island. Most islands are alike in these waters.",
"I see. Continue...",
"You have your jungle, rocks - a few deserted beaches here and there. That's it, really. However the land does give rich crops, so you'll find a lot of variety about.",
"I see. Continue...",
"I see. Now, if we may change the subject.",
"I'm not really interested in that.",
"Too bad, then. Tell me something else.",
"In these waters, forts are a necessary evil. Though this one is fairly small, it's a marvel - very well built and very strong. The engineers should be very proud. There are 800 soldiers on duty.",
"I see. Continue...",
"I shouldn't say any more. The commandant would run me through me if he found out I was talking about the fort, military secrecy and all. Maybe we'd better talk about something else.",
"All right...",
"I see. Now, let's change the subject.",
"I don't know a thing about him, I am sorry, miss ",
"Well, thank you, ",
