"Hello.",
"Hello, my friend! Haven't seen you in a while. How are you?",
"I'm doing fine. How about a mug?",
"Don't mind if I do.",
"You know, I'm hearing stories. Somebody's seen a boat with black sails near the island. The ship known as the 'Black Pearl.'",
"Yes, I've seen it, too. What's so special about it?",
"The 'Black Pearl' is a terrible ship. Many of my friends have run afoul of it and wound up dead.\nThey say that its captain is the devil himself, and his crew are living skeletons. If it's been seen in these parts, that's grave news for Falaise de Fleur.",
"You may be right. What else do they say about it?",
"Well, I've heard there is one ray of hope. It's said that this black frigate is nearly invincible - but not quite. There's one thing that even its captain fears as you and I fear death...\nSome enchanted artefact, supposedly found in the savage Incan jungle. They say it makes its owner unstoppable.",
"And who are 'they'? The same 'they' who see mermaids out at sea?",
"Some of them, yes. But many sober and trustworthy people have come to believe these tales as well. More and more men are out looking for that artefact. ",
"Well, that's a very entertaining tale, and I thank you for it. But now I must be going. Perhaps I'll see you again. ",
