"Hello, ",
", I am sorry but I'm in a hurry and I can't talk with you.",
"Excuse me, this will only take a moment. Do you have a brother whose name is Marc?",
"But, wait! I've got news about your brother.",
"Hello, ",
", I wanted to let you know that ",
"Orable Caron",
"Orable Caron",
" will not bother you again.",
"All right, you can go. I won't delay you further.",
"What's the rush?",
"Wait! I want to help you. I understand you have a problem.",
"I haven't much time. My father, ",
"Milon Blacque",
"Milon Blacque",
", is not well. I can't leave him alone for long.",
"Ah, is he the old man who lives by the pier?",
"What's wrong with him?",
"I hope he recovers. Goodbye.",
"I am sorry, ",
", but I really have to go.",
"You stubborn girl! Fine, away with you.",
"Yes, he is my father.",
"I've heard he is not in his right mind. Is that true?",
"It's unfortunate about your father. It's said that he's crazy, and I'm inclined to agree.",
"He didn't seem ill to me.",
"If you are so interested in my father, then ask those who like to wag their tongues.",
"I am sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.",
"Farewell, ",
". As I said, I'm busy, and I have to go now.",
"Then go. Go before he burns the house down, or eats sand! Crazy people can't be trusted to take care of themselves!",
"I think you'll hear this story sooner or later. Now excuse me, I have to go.",
"And I don't dare delay you.",
"Who doesn't have problems, ",
"?",
"Anyway, you know what I mean.",
"You're right. Everyone has problems, I suppose. ",
"Turpin Cabanel",
" was mistaken about you.",
"Don't make me tell you about that, ",
".",
"I can see that you don't want to talk about this. Farewell.",
"I just want to help you. Trust me.",
"No, I have no idea what you are talking about.",
"Goodbye, then.",
"Turpin Cabanel",
"? Oh! He is a very good man.",
"So was he correct? Do you have some problems or not?",
"I don't think I can talk about it, ",
".",
"I can see that you don't want to talk about this. Farewell.",
"I just want to help you. Trust me.",
"To help me? I think you'll hardly help a poor girl who even doesn't have money to buy food...",
"Tell me what has happened to you.",
"Ah, is that's your problem? Money? Here, take this. This should be enough for a while.",
"Everything is fine, ",
".",
"Well, if you don't want to tell me - goodbye.",
"Is that a bruise on your face? Has someone beaten you?",
"Oh, leave me alone, I have enough abuse from",
"Orable Caron",
"Orable Caron",
", then to have you torment me with your questions...",
"Fine, I'll not say a word from now on.",
"Orable Caron",
"Orable Caron",
" ? I shall have words with him.",
"Oh, please, don't! I don't want to hurt anyone.",
"Relax, I am not going to hurt anyone. I'll just talk to him a little bit.",
"Oh, ",
", thank you so much! How can I ever repay you?",
"Don't worry about it. I'm happy to help you.",
"Thank you, ",
".",
"You're welcome. Goodbye.",
"I had a brother. He died 5 years ago...",
"Hmm...that's strange...if he died, then how could he give me a letter?",
"A letter? From Marc? He's alive? Where is he?",
"Hey, hey, calm down. I gave the letter to your father. He seemed very happy to know that his son was safe and sound.",
"Where is he? Why hasn't he written for so long? Why didn't he come here?",
"I gave the letter to your crazy father, and if you want to know how your brother is, then I suppose you could go home and read it there.",
"That's a long story, I thought you were in a hurry?",
"No, my business can wait. Tell me how my brother is.",
"When he left 5 years ago, he fell into a pirate's hands, and he only managed to free himself recently. He lives in Redmond, and is now saving money in order to return home. His thoughts are of you and his father. You can find out for yourself by reading his letter - the one I gave to your father.",
"Thank you, ",
", you're right. I'll hurry home. You can't imagine how grateful I am. You've given my father his hope back.",
"Goodbye.",
"Yes, I am all ears, I hope you are not kidding.",
"I'm not. Your brother is chatting nicely with your father in the port now...",
"And why should I believe you? This is all a part of a cruel joke!",
"Don't think me such a brute! Perhaps you should go see for yourself before making such remarks. Good-bye.",
"Oh, my God! Marc is back after all these years?!",
"Yes, he's back. Now go to and see for yourself.",
