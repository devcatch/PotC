"Welcome to my tavern, stranger. My name is ",
". What brings you to my humble establishment? Do you need a place to rest?",
"Thank you. My name is ",
". I'm here on business.",
"My name is ",
", and you can spare your hospitality. I'm here on business.",
"Welcome, sir! What do you want?",
"I need some information, and I find the local innkeeper is usually the man to ask.",
"I'm looking to hire some sailors for my ship.",
"Point me to the patrons here who might be looking for a job. I need to add to my crew, and I don't mind if they're cutthroats.",
"Do you have a room? I'd like to stay here for a while.",
"Do you have a free bed in this hovel?",
"I don't have any business with you right now. Goodbye.",
"That's true. I hear most everything. What do you want to know?",
"They say that there's a pirate fort somewhere in the jungle. I need to know the way there.",
"I'm wondering if the ship named '",
"Ship Storage",
"' has been in port.",
"I'm looking for a man named ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"Raoul Rheims",
". Do you know if he has been on the island?",
"I'm told pirates have appeared on the island. Is that true?",
"I'm looking for a man named Rheims. Have you seen him?",
"What - my gold didn't bring you any luck?",
"I need a job. Don't you know any rich boys on this island who are afraid to travel alone?",
"I don't have any questions at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"Maybe they have. There are many rumors around.",
"I have a feeling you know more than just rumors. Like the location of the pirates' hideout!",
"I'm sorry, did you have a question? My hearing is not so good.\nBut 3000 gold pieces might just cure that.",
"Here's your cure - exactly 3000.",
"Isn't that's a lot of money for a little information?",
"Good, good. You wanted to find the pirate's hideout? It's deep inside the jungle, well hidden from prying eyes. ",
"I knew that much already. You'd best keep talking.",
"And I'd ask you to keep listening, my friend. The road from the town gate leads right into the jungle. You'll soon see a path leading to the left. Don't take that - go straight. At the next fork, turn right.\nAt the third, go left, and you'll soon find yourself where you need to be.",
"Thanks. That wasn't much work for so much money, was it?",
"Well, that's up to you. But I doubt you'd find it on your own.",
"All right, I'll pay. Talk.",
"We'll see.",
"Oh, I beg your pardon, ",
"! Please, forgive me. I didn't realize you were...here, I'll give it all back. I'll even pay you more!",
"Well, thank you.",
"You're in luck, my friend. That's him by the table near the window.",
"Thanks!",
"He called in here several times, but that was long ago. I remember him only because he paid me with Indian coins made of pure gold.",
"Well, thanks anyway. Some information is better than none at all. Let me ask you something else.",
"I'm sorry. I don't know anything about it.",
"That's too bad. And I don't have the money to rent a ship...",
"Then you need a job, don't you? To tell the truth, you won't find much here. But they say there are pirates somewhere on our island who will accept just about anyone into their ranks.",
"I don't suppose I have any choice but to work for them.",
"Mind if I ask why you want to go there?",
"I need to talk to ",
"Alistair Garcilaso",
"Alistair Garcilaso",
". I'd like to buy something from him.",
"As I understand it, you're talking about...",
"Checking my story, are you? Okay, I'll play your game. I'm talking about some Indian trinkets.",
"Don't take it personally. I have to check everyone in these troubled times. Wait for me here, and I'll see what I can do for you.",
"I'm not going anywhere soon.",
"Hurry. I'm a busy man.",
"It's a little too late in the day to find good sailors. They'll all be asleep or passed out by now. Come back in the morning - or you can spend the night here at the tavern.",
"All right. Do you have a room?",
"I don't need a room at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"I do have a vacancy. How long are you going to stay?",
"Overnight.",
"Just until dark.",
"Fine. That will be 5 gold pieces.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"Sadly, I don't think I can afford anything better than a night in the tavern hall.",
"What - does that come with a personal staff? I'll pass.",
"I'll think about it.",
"Fine. That will be 5 gold pieces.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"Sadly, I don't think I can afford anything better than a night in the tavern hall.",
"That's too much. I'll stay in the tavern hall.",
"I'll think about it.",
"Dear visitors! Please stop this outrage! Don't force me to call the guards!",
"All right, all right! I'm already gone!",
"If he is they prefer to sail in with less satellites, you know this", 
"Yes, I forgot. Alright, I'll come back later, when I have fewer ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you. You've done caused too much trouble for my country",
"Just look at this patriot. Well, goodbye.", 
"Your hands are covered in blood. You don't seriously think that anyone would travel with you, do you?",
"You are right, everyone's afraid of me! Ha-ha!",
"You arrived just in time. A merchant here was searching for the right company to travel with. You should talk to him. There he is, just coming in to the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody like that at the moment, Maybe next time.",
"Hmm, then I will wait.",
