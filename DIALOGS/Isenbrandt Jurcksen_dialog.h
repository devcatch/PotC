"That's none of your business.",

"Well, here it is, right on top of my shoulders. You're welcome to try and take it!",
"Ah! It's the valiant ",
", friend and hero to the downtrodden masses! What brings a noble man like you to seek out a villainous pirate such as myself?",
"Ah! It's you, ",
", whose ruthless and bloodthirsty reputation threatens to surpass even my own! What brings you to me?",
"I've come to give you this letter.",
"You're more of a clown than I would've expected. Just take this letter I've brought for you, so I can be on my way.",
"I feel as though I should be familiar with you, lad...but for the life of me I can't imagine why. Who are you?",
"My name is ",
", and I'm here on business. I brought you a letter.",
"A letter, you say? I'd like to know from who.",
"Why do you have to know who sent it? Why not just read it for yourself? Or do you need me to read it to you?",
"Watch your tongue, boy, or I'll take your head as a trophy!",

"Let me explain where you're wrong, lad. This town is mine. This island is mine. And everything that happens here happens because I will it.",
"So you're what, then -- a pirate chieftain?",
"I prefer to think of myself as governor of an independent colony. But I'm still waiting for your answer.",
"What kind of civilization do you have here, where a poor girl is just trying to find her lover and everybody immediately sets up a clamor!",
"Lover? Haha, you don't say so! Miracles still take place in this world! Why did he leave you?",
"Tell me, was he here? When? Where did he go?",
"He was here...making repairs after a storm. But I don't know where he sailed. He didn't tell. All right, take your leave now.",
