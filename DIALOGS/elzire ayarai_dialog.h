"Thank you for your help, ",

"Not at all. It's reward enough to see you living your life again. Good luck!",
"Who are you, and what are you doing in my home? I ask you to leave at once!",
"I'm sorry for the intrusion. I'll go.",
"Who are you, and what are you doing here?",
"I've come at the request of the priest.",
"I thank you for what you've done, ",
".",
"My reward is seeing you back living your own life. Good luck to you!",
"Who are you, and what are you doing in my home? I ask you to leave at once!",
"I'm sorry for the intrusion. I'll go.",
"Why? Did that hypocrite finally give up on making me go to church?",
"I suppose that's true. He no longer believes he can change your mind. He tells me you're too stubborn.",
"Stubborn? Hardly.",
"What do I tell him, then? Why do you refuse to return to God?",
"I never left God. He left me. When the English attacked my husband's ship and killed him, where was God?",
"I'm sorry for your loss. I can only imagine how hard it is for you. But...",
"And where was God when my son was run down by a wagon? He's not even five years old, sir, and now he lies paralyzed for life!",
"I can't answer that. But I know some people believe that these things happen to test our faith, to refine it in fire...",
"And where was God when I was desperate for a job. When I needed money to pay for my son's medical care? Where was He then?!",
"I can see that nothing I say will change your mind, madam. Goodbye.",
"Perhaps God has brought me to help you.",
"Help me? How? Can you give me back my husband? Make my son walk again?!",
"No. I'm not God. I can't do those things. But that doesn't mean that I can't help you.",
"Words! I've had my fill of words. I'm sick to death of them! You're just like that priest - you talk and talk, and nothing changes.",
"You know, you may be right. Perhaps I'm wasting my time. Goodbye.",
"If you would just listen for a moment. Just give me a chance - ",
"No one can help me. Just go!",
"Fine. I'll do that. I can't help someone who won't be helped.",
"You're looking for a sign from God, but you refuse to see it when it may be right in front of you. I'm no angel, madam, but you say you need money to cure your son. I can give it to you, and - God willing - your son will be healed.",
"You say you need money to heal your son. I don't have it now, but I'll get it. Somehow, I'll get it, and I'll bring it to you. That's the only miracle I can offer.",
"Please, sir. Don't toy with me. You only make matters worse. No man on the face of this cursed earth would give a stranger that kind of money.",
"I'm pleased to prove you wrong. Here is 1000 gold exactly. That should be enough to heal your son.",
"Yes. You've lost your faith in both God and Man. I see that now. I'll not waste my time trying to prove you wrong. Goodbye.",
"You give me this money and ask nothing in return?",
"I ask you for just one thing: If you've found consolation in your faith in the past, I only hope you'll consider embracing it again. If not in God, then in your fellow man. Farewell, madam.",
