"Be gone.",
"I'm leaving.",
"Unless you're here to donate more of your money, you'd best be leavin'. Ha ha ha ha!",
"I'll recall it to you.",
"We meet again, Captain.",
"Ah, I thought I smelled something foul.",
"Come, join me.",
"Not now. Maybe some other time.",
"With pleasure. Are you going to buy me a drink?",
" ! You've paid my debt! Thank you!",
"You're welcome. Here, take your receipt.",
"You haven't paid me yet, have you?",
"No, wait a little while longer.",
"*Gasp!* How dare you to talk with me like that!",
"I'll talk anyway I like. What, you want to teach me some manners?",
"You're lucky there are guards about, otherwise I'd have my blade at your throat...",
"You'd be dead before your weapon left its sheathe.",
"Captain, if I could be so bold...would you please buy me a drink? I've already run up a considerable tab, I'm afraid....",
"How much do you owe?",
"Oh, I'm so sorry, but I really must be going...",
"500 gold.",
"That's quite a debt. Good luck paying it off.",
"Only 500? That's not so bad. Perhaps I can pay it for you.",
"Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much!",
"No, wait. I don't have the money now.",
"Is that all? No problem. I'll pay it for you now.",
"Oh, Captain, thank you once again!",
"I'll be back in no time.",
"Ha! What a fool! Tavern keeper! Bring me some wine!",
"Wait...you said that you don't have any money.",
"I guess I did, didn't I? Maybe you should be more careful who you trust, eh? Now get out of here.",
"You...you thief! Give me back my money!",
"Ah, but you've been swindled fair and square, my friend! Now leave my sight...unless you prefer I beat you within an inch of your life?",
"Not today!",
