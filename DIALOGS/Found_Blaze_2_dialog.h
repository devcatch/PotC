"Captain! I can scarce believe my eyes!",
"Believe them, my friend. It's me!",
"Thank God you're alive!",
"What are you all doing here?",
"It's a miracle that you survived, sir! A plain miracle. God must be with you!",
"Yes. Sometimes I wonder about that.",
"...or the sea-devil! I've heard he will look favorably on bold sailors and keep them from disaster.",
"What, more tall tales?",
"No tales, sir! Jovannie Speckled from the brig 'Ardent' told me that he saw the sea-devil with his own eyes!",
"Is that right? And how many bottles of rum had he put away when he saw this devil?",
"He swore he never touched a drop, captain...",
"Wait here, my friends!",
"We'll wait for you here, captain, as you say. But if something goes wrong, just rush back here. We'll cover you! We'll fight to the death if we must!",
"All right. But don't show yourself too soon.",
"We'll take him to our ship, captain. I'm glad everything has ended so well.",
"Has it? Go, now. Go, and I'll follow you soon.",
