"Hello. My name's Nathaniel Hawk. I'm looking for an officer who's missing from my ship. Have you seen anyone who might fit his description? He looks harmless enough - no sword, good suit...",
"So, did you found your man?",
"I'm still looking for him.",
"Hello, stranger.",
"Hello.",
"You know, I did see one man here in pretty fine clothes, and I don't believe he carried a blade. He was talking with another man I didn't recognize. \n Then, out of the clear blue sky, bandits burst in and shot the man he was speaking to. \n Their victim is upstairs now, recovering from his wounds. If he's conscious, he may be able to help you find your missing crewman.",
"Thanks for your help.",
