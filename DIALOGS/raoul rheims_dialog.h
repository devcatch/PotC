"So, what are we going to talk about? Who's that?!",
"Who?! Where?!",
"Cough-cough, that mongrel finally got me.",
"Governor Silehard?",
"And his band of thugs.",
"Please, lie still and save your breath. Your wounds, they're too serious...I don't think you'll make it to my ship.",
"I know, girl, I know. Cough, cough... Do you know why ",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
" wanted me to die?",
"Yes, the Incan treasure.",
"Indeed. He's lusted for it ever since he heard of it. I beg you - carry it off under his very nose. That will be a just revenge for my death...cough-cough.",
"Yes, and I'll take care of the governor as well. Of that you can be certain. He has sent his murderers after me since I learned of the treasure.",
"No. Don't kill him, my girl. He's too powerful and too well guarded. And it is far more important that you guard the treasure.",
"Why?",
"There is far more to this treasure than it seems. The information that ",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
" has is not complete. I've only recently figured it out myself, but there is much, much more.\nIn my initial pursuit of the treasure, I found a legend that described how to find these artifacts.\nUnfortunately, it was an incomplete transcription from the Isla Muelle's church library.\nI am sure that there you can find a complete version. And there is one more thing. \nFind the Khirucatceliti idol and it will open the door...",
"Goodbye. Rest in peace.",
"Yes? But who are you and what do you need from me?",
"Relax, we just need to talk to you ",
"I can tell by your faces that our conversation won't be pleasant, but I guess I don't have any choice.\nLet's go to my house outside town and talk there.",
"Don't even think of trying to slip away!",
"I won't.",
"All right, then let's go.",
