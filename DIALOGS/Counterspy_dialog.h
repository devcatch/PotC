"Sir, are you Captain ",
"?",
"Who wants to know?",
"I'm ",
". I've received a mission from His Majesty, and it's my understanding you will transport me to Oxbay.",
"Yes, that's right. I trust you have a plan?",
"Not precisely. I just have to find a way to sneak into the French ranks and do a little damage.",
"I see. That's just a little vague for my tastes. But I may be able to help you out.",
"I would appreciate that. But how?",
"Let's just say I have some connections among the French. Let's get going, and I'll explain once we're under way.",
"I beg your pardon - are we to leave right away?",
"Are you in such a hurry to reach the lion's den?",
"What good is waiting here? The sooner it's started, the sooner it's finished!",
"True, true. Don't worry, we'll set sail soon.",
"Quiet! Was that the door? I don't like this. Watch the stairs, and stand ready!",
"Are you expecting trouble?",
"Who are you, and what do you want?",
"Keep a civil tongue in your head, or you'll find it on the floor. I'm from the governor.",
"Finally! Thank God. Pardon my manner; I must act the part of a French soldier.",
"I understand completely. Sir Silehard sent me to help you.",
"Then listen closely: I recently learned that a French captain lost a small fortune at backgammon. You're familiar with the game?",
"Of course - but what does it have to do with your mission?",
"I became acquainted with this captain, yes? Won his trust. And he told me he'd lost such a lot of money that he'd never be able to pay it off. Indeed, he was prepared to take his own life when I offered him another way out of his predicament.\nI offered to pay his debt myself if he would sail his ship to Redmond and give it up to our soldiers. He agreed.",
"Incredible! He must have truly been desperate to agree to that! Just how much did he lose?",
"Never mind that. We arranged to meet today. I'm going to give him the money, and the English fleet will grow by one more ship.",
"Excellent! But what do you need from me?",
"Blast! They've found me! We've got to get out of here immediately!",
"How? They're sure to be waiting for us at the entrance to the city!",
"I'm not leaving the city - my work here isn't done yet. But I know a person who might hide us until things cool down.",
"Who?",
"It's the owner of the local shipyard - ",
"Oweyn McDorey",
"Oweyn McDorey",
". We should go there straight away.",
"I don't suppose we have much choice. Let's go.",
"Try to avoid the French soldiers along the way - otherwise we may never reach the shipyard.",
"Believe me, if there's a fight, it won't be because I started it.",
"We must get to the shipyard!",
"I know that! Where do you think I'm headed?",
"I've got to keep my agreement with that French captain - the bloodless capture of a French ship is too good to pass up. But I can't imagine how I'll reach him. I'm sure there are guards at the gates leading to the jungle.",
"What's your plan?",
"I have the money I promised the Frenchman. But the guards know my face now; I wouldn't make it far on the streets.",
"Where and when were you supposed to meet him?",
"He'll be in the tavern this evening, but I can't go there and risk being recognized.",
"What can we do, then?",
"We've got to let him know to find us somewhere else. Somewhere safe. Look, no one knows you here, right? You can go and tell the French captain I'll wait for him behind the tavern, by the city wall.",
"I don't know. I'm not exactly incognito here. I've already been caught in one fight.",
"Don't worry about that. The other participants are in no condition to speak now, are they? And as for",
"Everard Gordon",
" he won't give you away. Besides, my friend - if you don't go, then we are out of options.",
"Right. Fine. What's this Frenchman's name?",
"Rabel Iverneau",
"Rabel Iverneau",
". He'll be sitting at the front of the bar, under the stairs.",
"Got it. Let's try and get some rest 'til the evening comes.",
"It's time. Move carefully and calmly, and you'll have no trouble from the guards.",
"From your mouth to God's ears, my friend.",
"Yes, that is the usual route. By the way, I almost forgot. We sail away from this island on the French ship and your people, I think, should return to your ship and deliver it to Redmond.",
"No, I've got it down. Wish me luck.",
"Let's hope you don't need luck. Now, go!",
"I'm already gone.",
"Hello. I see ",
"Rabel Iverneau",
" joined us.",
"Okay, so what's next? How do we get into the ship ",
"Rabel Iverneau",
"?",
"Here's what we do: ",
"Rabel Iverneau",
" will go to ahead to his ship - business as usual - and we'll simply follow him as captives or attendants.",
"That's insane. It just might work.",
"We'll need to stay close to him. And let's pray we don't get stopped.",
"Sure, otherwise the French will be in real trouble.",
"That's the spirit, my friend. But I don't believe they'll be a problem. Soon enough, we'll be away.",
"I'll believe it when we're on board the ship. Until then, I'm keeping my fingers crossed!",
