"I've seen your fight with our cap. Well, according to our law you're now our new captain, and the ship belongs to you.",
"Where can I find it?",
"Oh, it's nearby, at the Palm Beach bay. Turn left when you exit the village, and you'll soon see it.",
"Perfect! With me around, you'll know what it means to be real sea dogs, lads!",
"Ugh. You must be that captain Artois was talking about. You're late... Unghh... If you'd came only five minutes earlier, I wouldn't have this dagger sticking out of my chest. Ungh...",
"Damn! Somebody stabbed this lad!",
"Get lost, sucker!",
"With pleasure. But not until I find out why one of my men is lying unconscious on the grass, and in your company.",
"This is your last mistake! Lads, get him!",
"Try it, filthy hyenas!",
"I'm afraid that your man is not well. He caught a bullet with his lung, and he needs a surgeon.",
"How much will it going to cost me?",
"Quite much. I ask 2000 gold for my services.",
"Deal. The life of my officer is more important than the dull glitter of gold.",
"With prices like that, I'd rather let him die!",
"And one more thing. Your officer is delirious - he said that the attacks may continue. His recovery will take two weeks. Maybe you should put someone to guard him during this time?",
"Hm... Indeed, this is not the first attempt on Artois. I'll guard him myself.",
"Two weeks?! No way, I'm outta here!",
"I'm sorry, captain, but I'm not going to sail with you anymore. You're too bloodthirsty for me. Farewell.",
"Get lost, sucker!",
"I'm sick of sailing with a spineless worm like you. Goodbye, I'll go find myself someone bloodthirsty enough!",
"Suit yourself!",
"What do you want?",
"I want you to join me on my journeys.",
"Very well, but take care not to repeat what made me leave you last time.",
"Good.",
"I've heard you are looking for job",
"Something like that. And I've heard you are looking for a man to guide you and your ship.",
"You are right. I think you're just the man I'm looking for. Would you like to sail with me?",
"How much money will you pay me?",
"I need you to follow me to ",
" and I will pay you ",
" gold coins.",
"I agree",
"I decline you proposition",
"Thank you, I feel my fate is in good hands. Here is your money.",
"Thank you.",
