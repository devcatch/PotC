"I'll think about it.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold coins.",

"Do you know where he is now?",
"I'm not sure where he went, but it's possible I can tell you why he's gone...",
"Please do. It's vital that I know!",
"Well, rumor has it the young Spaniard tried to make time with Governor Silehard's daughter. I don't know what happened, but he came in here afterwards in the blackest of moods. The very next morning, he and his yacht were gone, and no one here has seen him since.",
"The governor's daughter? The man has good taste, doesn't he? Any chance I could speak with her, or does Silehard watch her too closely?",
"Oh, you can be sure when he's not watching her, someone in his pay is doing it for him. Well, he has his reasons, doesn't he? She's a fine-looking girl. She does occasionally take a walk outside of town, but she's always escorted by several guards.",
"Those guards shouldn't be a problem - I'm not intending to kidnap her or anything, just ask a few questions. Thanks, Charles, you've been a big help.",
