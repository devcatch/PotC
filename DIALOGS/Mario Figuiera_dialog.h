"Welcome to my tavern, stranger. My name is ",
", and by the look of you I'm guessing you're not here to drink.",
"My name is ",
", and you're right. I'm here on business.",
"My name is ",
", and I'm definitely not interested in what you're serving. I want some answers.",
"How can I help you?",
"I need information.",
"I'm looking to hire some sailors for my crew.",
"Point me to the rabble looking for work. I need some cutthroats who don't ask too many questions.",
"Do you have a free room? I'd like to stay here for a while.",
"I need a clean room with a clean bed. Nothing fancy.",
"I don't need anything at the moment. Goodbye.",
"I do have a room available. How long did you plan to stay?",
"Until morning.",
"Just until nightfall.",
"It will cost you 5 gold.",
"Fine. Here you go.",
"Alas, it appears the luxury of sleeping in an actual bed is out of my reach at the moment. I'll spend the night here in the tavern.",
"No thanks. If that's the price, I'll just sleep here in the common room.",
"I'll think about it.",
"It will cost you 5 gold.",
"Fine. Here you go.",

"No thanks. If that's the price, I'll just sleep here in the common room.",
"I'll think about it.",
"I'm not surprised that you'd come to me. A man picks up a lot of information in my line of work. What do you want to know?",
"I don't have any questions for you at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"At this hour? All the sailors will be at home, or passed out somewhere. \nIf you're looking to hire, you should wait until morning. You might rent a room here in the meantime.",
"Do you have a vacant room?",
"Maybe later. Let me ask you about something else.",
"Gentlemen, please! Cease this madness at once, or I'll have to call for the guards!",
"Don't bother. I was just leaving.",
